      <p>I love eating young ducklings. They are so delicious and tender. I go a certain restaurant that has whole smoked ducklings and they are so tasty. I also eat bees because they are yellow, and I LOVE yellow. The beaks are not very good though :(</p>

      <h2>Oppenheimer</h2>
      <h5>Movie Review</h5>

      <p>Christopher Nolan as one of my favourite, if not favourite film directors. When I first heard that Oppenheimer was his next film, I was a bit skeptical. Oppenheimer is a drama/biography which is a genre Nolan has not tackled before. However, it turned out to be a great film that I enjoyed. I saw it with my family when it came out.</p>

      <h2>Bringing Down the House</h2>
      <h5>Book Review</h5>
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51tddaAA4WL._AC_UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg" style="height:600px;">
      <p>The book is written almost like a novel but it follows the five years of Kevin Lewis's life amongst his group of card counters and the successes they have in the casinos. The book is a great read especially because my topic for the I-search is gambling. It did not take long to read, and was very enjoayble. I reccomend this book to everyone.</p>
